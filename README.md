# PDF TO ANKI(ES)
This is a program that asks the user(in the cli when you run the file) which file they want to use for the convertion(must be a PDF and must contain only spanish words) and it will automatically convert those words into anki flashcards in an anki deck(will be in italian as default since im italian). The flashcards will also contain the audio with proper pronunciation of the word/s.
