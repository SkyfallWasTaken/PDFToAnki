Im now thinking on how to solve a bug, in my current code i've managed to properly print the words,translation, phonemes.Still need to implement sending it to anki and how its pronounced(with gtts). My problem rn is that with my trans function i also return
unecessary data like source and destination languages. Here is my function:
def trans(text):
    translator = Translator()
    translation= translator.translate(text, dest= "it")
    return translation
Right now i've figured that translation is a list (split doesnt work while something like sorted does) and i need to understand how to index from after "text="
Thought id use slicing but i guess not
Switching over to make my transcription function work properly as i cant find the solution
I think im going to change library for the transcription because the docs are not good
made slight improvements to the trans function, might not need another library as googltrans already does it for me. Need to figure out how to separate in two values
the program outputs an anki deck file in the folder where the program is, the problem is that anki has been freezed for like 3 minutes when i tried importing the file, which makes me worry a little.
In the meantime i will add support to french and russian using sys.argv and conditional statements/ match case
